            <h1>California Wildfire Disaster Analysis</h1>
            <p>
                Our intention is to create a intractive visualization application that elicits the adverse effect of these disasters. We selected a Kaggle dataset showing the top 20 wildfire disasters in California History. This was re-engineered to fit the purpose of this application after data preprocessing steps were implemented.
            </p> 
            <p>
                This dataset contains the top 20 wildfires in California that are largest in terms of the number of acres affected. Each row represents a wildfire, and the rows are sorted in descending order of acres. The columns contain information on the name, cause, start time (month and year), location (county), and damages (number of acres, structures, and deaths) for each wildfire.
